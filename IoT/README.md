## Analytics
- [eKuiper](https://www.lfedge.org/projects/ekuiper/) - "eKuiper is an edge lightweight IoT data analytics / streaming software implemented by Golang, and it can be run on all kinds of resource-constrained edge devices. It migrates cloud real-time cloud streaming analytics frameworks such as Apache Spark, Apache Storm and Apache Flink to the edge. eKuiper references these cloud streaming frameworks, and also considers any special requirements of edge analytics, to introduce  rule engine, which is based on Source, SQL (business logic) and Sink;  rule engine is used for developing streaming applications at the edge.
