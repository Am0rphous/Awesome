# Cryptography

- [Ciphey](https://github.com/Ciphey/Ciphey) - Automatically decrypt encryptions without knowing the key or cipher, decode encodings, and crack hashes
- [CSCI-462](https://github.com/sarah-dill/CSCI-462) - Contains scripts from the class CSCI-462 Introduction to Cryptography 
- [Crypto](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto) - The Crypto interface represents basic cryptography features available in the current context. It allows access to a cryptographically strong random number generator and to cryptographic primitives.
- [CryptoHack.org](https://cryptohack.org/) - A fun free platform for learning modern cryptography.
- [Dcipher](https://github.com/k4m4/dcipher) - Decipher hashes using online rainbow & lookup table attack services.
- [DEScrypto](https://github.com/DedSecInside/DEScrypto) - DES Encrypter/Decrypter.
- [Encrypting Kali Setup Tutorial (working pr. 10.11.20)](https://www.informaticar.net/how-to-manually-partition-and-encrypt-kali-linux/)
- [End-to-end](https://github.com/google/end-to-end) - End-To-End is a crypto library to encrypt, decrypt, digital sign, and verify signed messages (implementing OpenPGP).
- [GEA1_break](https://github.com/airbus-seclab/GEA1_break) - Implementation of the key recovery attack against GEA-1 keys (Eurocrypt 2021).
- [GnuPGP](https://gnupg.org/) - The GNU Privacy Guard. GnuPG is a complete and free implementation of the OpenPGP standard as defined by RFC4880 (also known as PGP). GnuPG allows you to encrypt and sign your data and communications; it features a versatile key management system, along with access modules for all kinds of public key directories. GnuPG, also known as GPG, is a command line tool with features for easy integration with other applications. A wealth of frontend applications and libraries are available. GnuPG also provides support for S/MIME and Secure Shell (ssh).

- [Hotp-js - A JavaScript HOTP implementation](https://github.com/adulau/hotp-js) - A simple Javascript HOTP implementation (HMAC-Based One-Time Password Algorithm) as described in RFC 4226. The library relies on crypto-js (http://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/) for the javascript HMAC-SHA1 implementation.
- [LibreCrypt](https://github.com/t-d-k/LibreCrypt) - LibreCrypt: Transparent on-the-fly disk encryption for Windows. LUKS compatible.
- [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl) - TLS/SSL and crypto library.
