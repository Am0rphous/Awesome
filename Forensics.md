- [Cerbero Suite](https://cerbero.io/)
- [CFF Explorer / Explorer Suite](http://www.ntcore.com/exsuite.php)
- [DynLogger](https://www.ntcore.com/?page_id=376) - logs all dynamically retrieved functions by reporting the module name and the requested function. It also logs loaded modules. It can come very handy when one wants to know a “hidden” function used by an application.

## Process Analysis
- [Process Dump (Windows))](https://github.com/glmcdona/Process-Dump) - Windows tool for dumping malware PE files from memory back to disk for analysis.
