## 5. Peripherals & Hardware
- For competitive gaming ensure keyboard support
  - Anti-Ghosting "unintended keystrokes are registered when multiple keys are pressed"
  - "N-Key Rollover (NKRO) is a keyboard feature that determines how many keys can be pressed simultaneously while still being correctly registered by the keyboard. "N" stands for any given number, indicating that a keyboard with full NKRO can detect unlimited simultaneous key presses without making mistakes. This feature is particularly useful for gamers, programmers, and typists who rely on quick and precise inputs."
