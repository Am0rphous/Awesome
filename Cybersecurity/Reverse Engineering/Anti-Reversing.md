# Anti-Reverse Engineering

- [APICallProxy](https://github.com/MahmoudZohdy/APICallProxy) - This Project is for Windows API Call Obfuscation to make static/Dynamic analysis of a program harder, and to make it harder to recognize and extract the sequance of Windows API the application Call.
- [BeatRev](https://github.com/Octoberfest7/BeatRev) - POC for frustrating/defeating Malware Analysts 
- [Ekko](https://github.com/Cracked5pider/Ekko) - Sleep Obfuscation 
- [The Anti-Analysis Menagerie](https://github.com/ex0dus-0x/menagerie) - Cross-platform malware development library for anti-analysis techniques 

## Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM)
- [llvm.org](https://llvm.org/)
- [YANSOllvm](https://github.com/emc2314/YANSOllvm) - Yet Another Not So Obfuscated LLVM 

## Memory
- [DeepSleep](https://github.com/thefLink/DeepSleep) - A variant of Gargoyle for x64 to hide memory artifacts using ROP only and PIC 

## x86 / 32-bit
- [x86 Code Virtualizer (Code Obfuscator)](https://github.com/NIKJOO/x86-Code-Virtualizer) - Protect and obfuscate sensitive area of code using virtual machine protection ( translation of byte-code to PCode and run them inside Virtual Machine ) Project has been writen in Microsoft VC++ & little pure asm code and uses BeaEngine as disassembler engine. It's not enough secure to use in commercial projects so try to learn how it works and make it better.
