## Performance tip
- Ensure enough RAM and multiple cores on the system with high clock speed (Giga Hertz).
- Ensure that CPU supports AES. Check with `cat /proc/cpuinfo |grep aes`
- Disable `BandwidthRate` in config?
- Increase system limits like `ulimit -n`
- Tor config
````
MaxMemInQueues 10 GB #Limit to 45% av physical RAM
NumCPUs 8            #Adjust tor to use more cores. Might be a limit on 2 cores(?)
````

  - If you get error `Cannot read TOR's control_auth_cookie` then try:
  ````shell
  sudo usermod -aG $USER debian-tor             #run this
  sudo adduser $USER debian-tor                 # or this one (ubuntu)
  #sudo chmod 644 /run/tor/control.authcookie   #be careful with this one
  nyx
  nyx -i 127.0.0.1:9051    #connect to localhost on the port 9051

  - [https://docs.onionshare.org](https://docs.onionshare.org) - CLI](https://docs.onionshare.org/2.3.1/en/advanced.html#command-line-interface)
- For macOS just run `brew install --cask onionshare`
- For Linux: 
  ````shell
  sudo apt install onionshare
  onionshare-cli --chat                                                        # start a chat server
  onionshare-cli --receive --persistent ~/anon-dropbox.session --public        # start a persistent anonymous dropbox
  ````

## Whonix - A secure OS routing traffic through Tor
- [Whonix ‚Ñ¢ for KVM](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/KVM)
Commands
  ````shell
  tar -xvf Whonix-*.xz
  sudo virsh -c qemu:///system net-define Whonix_external*.xml
  sudo virsh -c qemu:///system net-define Whonix_internal*.xml
  sudo virsh -c qemu:///system net-autostart Whonix-External
  sudo virsh -c qemu:///system net-start Whonix-External
  sudo virsh -c qemu:///system net-autostart Whonix-Internal
  sudo virsh -c qemu:///system net-start Whonix-Internal
  ````
- Access over vnc: edit `/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf` and restart libvirtd
- KVM image failed to start with virsh, permission denied
  ````shell
  User = "root"
  group = "root"
  vnc_listen = "0.0.0.0"
  virt-viewer vnc://localhost:5901
  ````
- Routing another VM through Whonix on Virtualbox: First remove the default nic. Then add the internal whonix-nic to the VM. Then give the VM network settings which may look like:
  ````shell
  iface eth0 inet static
    address 10.152.152.11
    netmask 255.255.192.0
    gateway 10.152.152.10
    dns-nameservers 10.152.152.10 #cant remember if this was correct syntax lol
  ````
