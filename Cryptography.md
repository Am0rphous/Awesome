# Cryptography

- [CryptoHack.org](https://cryptohack.org/) - A fun free platform for learning modern cryptography.
- [Dcipher](https://github.com/k4m4/dcipher) - Decipher hashes using online rainbow & lookup table attack services.
- [DEScrypto](https://github.com/DedSecInside/DEScrypto) - DES Encrypter/Decrypter.
- [End-to-end](https://github.com/google/end-to-end) - End-To-End is a crypto library to encrypt, decrypt, digital sign, and verify signed messages (implementing OpenPGP).
- [GEA1_break](https://github.com/airbus-seclab/GEA1_break) - Implementation of the key recovery attack against GEA-1 keys (Eurocrypt 2021).
- [Hotp-js - A JavaScript HOTP implementation](https://github.com/adulau/hotp-js) - A simple Javascript HOTP implementation (HMAC-Based One-Time Password Algorithm) as described in RFC 4226. The library relies on crypto-js (http://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/) for the javascript HMAC-SHA1 implementation.
- [RSACrack](https://github.com/b4den/rsacrack) - A toolbox for extracting RSA private keys from public keys.

## Digital Signatures
