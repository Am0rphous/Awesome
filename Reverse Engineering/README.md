# Reverse Engineering Tools

Reverse engineering is the process of analyzing a product or system in order to understand how it works, in order to replicate or improve upon it. This can involve taking apart and examining the product, creating a diagram or model of its components and their interactions, and studying the design and function of each component. Reverse engineering is often used to reverse-engineer software, in order to understand how it works, identify vulnerabilities, or create compatible products. It can also be used to reverse-engineer physical products, in order to understand their design and create replicas or knockoffs.
